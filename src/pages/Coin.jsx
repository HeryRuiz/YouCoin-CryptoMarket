                    ? `${coinData.name} is a global, open-source platform for
                      decentralized applications. In other words, the vision is
                      to create a world computer that anyone can build
                      applications in a decentralized manner; while all states
                      and data are distributed and publicly accessible. $
                      ${coinData.name} supports smart contracts in which developers
                      can write code in order to program digital value. Examples
                      of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on $
                      ${coinData.name} includes tokens, non-fungible tokens,
                      decentralized finance apps, lending protocol,
                      decentralized exchanges, and much more. On Ethereum, all
                      transactions and smart contract executions require a small
                      fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical
                      terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of
                      computational effort required to execute an operation or a
                      smart contract. The more complex the execution operation
                      is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation.
                      Gas fees are paid entirely in ${coinData.symbol}, which is the
                      native coin of the blockchain. The price of gas can
                      fluctuate from time to time depending on the network
                      demand.`
                    : `Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is
                  any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and
                  uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies
                  don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead
                  using a decentralized system to record transactions and issue
                  new units.Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that
                  doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It is a
                  peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send
                  and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried
                  around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency
                  payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database
                  describing specific transactions. When you transfer
                  cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a
                  public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.
                  Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to
                  verify transactions. This means advanced coding is involved in
                  storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets
                  and to public ledgers. The aim of encryption is to provide
                  security and safety. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin,
                  which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today.
                  Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for
                  profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.`}
